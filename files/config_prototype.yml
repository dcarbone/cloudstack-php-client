# PHP CloudStack Client generator config prototype

# Any option defined in src/Command/AbstractCommand.php can be defined, excluding the "config" and "env" flag.

# Combining rules:
# - If an option is NOT defined here and NOT defined explicitly at runtime, the default value will be used.  If there is
#   no default value for that option, the command will fail.
# - If an option is defined here but NOT defined explicitly at runtime, the value present here will be used.
# - If an option is defined here AND defined explicitly at runtime, the runtime option will be used in favor of the
#   value defined here.
# - If a value is NOT defined here but is defined explicitly at runtime, the runtime value will be used.
